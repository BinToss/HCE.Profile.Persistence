<p align="center">Paper on the specifications of the blam.sav binary.</p>

# Introduction

This paper covers the profile properties that are stored in the `blam.sav` binary, which is generated by HCE in the `savegames` directory for preserving user configurations. This document's purpose is to allow [TCE](https://github.com/tiarace) to implement 1:1 compatibility with a user's HCE profile.
The methodology, offsets and attributes of the properties are showcased with descriptions and code examples in either C++ or Python.
